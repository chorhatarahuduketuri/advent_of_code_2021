# Advent of Code 2021

This year I'm planning to ~~over engineer~~ have better infrastructure for my code (and also actually finish it, or at least get past day 8...)

Hopefully this will include: 

- pytest ✔️
- ~~black and flake8~~ ❌ absolutely not they ruin my beautiful list comprehensions
- GitHub Actions ✔️
- Perhaps a decorator?
- The totally ~~unnecessary~~ reasonable use of a context manager
